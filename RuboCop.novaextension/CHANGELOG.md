  incorrect location format.

  output from the RuboCop command (thanks @toadle).

  RuboCop configuration (thanks @jbeker).

## Version 0.5.0

- Added notifications of RuboCop invocation errors.

- Added better error handling when running the `rubocop` command so that we
  don't completely blow up when there are configuration warnings and errors.

  environment.

## Version 0.4.0

- Improved the speed of executing RuboCop by caching the environment checks
  that determine which RuboCop installation to use.
- Reverted change from 0.2.2 that configured RuboCop to omit cop names from

  versions of RuboCop.

  RuboCop could not be found.
